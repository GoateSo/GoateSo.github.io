    <h1> Fall 2024 ~ My Current Term</h1>
    <p> 
        Now that I've covered most of my introductory classes, my main goal with this current semester is to focus much more directly on some of the theory and applications that I've been interested in exploring.

    <h2> CS 537: Introduction to Operating Systems</h2>
    <p style="text-indent:30px;"> 
        One of the best esteemed classes in the department, and for good reason at that. So far, the material coverage (OSTEP baby) plus the method of teaching and presentation have been quite good. In terms of projects, perhaps the class moves a bit slower than others (like apparently McGill in Canada), but once they get larger in scope, I generally find them fun to tinker around with. Starting with project three, it's been quite intriguing to figure out the implementations behind some of the abstractions that I've taken for granted in high level applications. That said, I do however wish that discussion sections would be better utilized than mere exam review and project tidbits, but I can sort of understand given their optional nature.

        The lectures and exam structure largely follow the breakdown of the textbook, OSTEP, splitting the class into three sections focused on CPU/Memory virtualization, concurrency, and interaction with persistent storage.

    <h2> CS 564: Database Management Systems </h2>
    <p style="text-indent:30px;"> 
        DBMS probably takes the cake as the class I've taken with the most entertaining lectures so far. The professor, AnHai Doan, is uniquely charismatic among the many I've seen so far, and has been a major justification for taking the class in his own right. As of writing (Oct. 20), there has yet to be any particularly large projects or exams, so I'll hold off on any further comment until later.

    <h2> CS 704: Principles of Programming Languages </h2>
    <p>
        There is a common quip that all branches of computer science are just applied math (whether its Algorithms and discrete math or machine learning and linear algebra), and Programming Languages as discussed here is no exception. The class, up until now, has been largely focused on the theory behind the semantics and evaluation of programming languages, both functional and imperative.

        The  is quite heavy, with the professor heavily emphasizing the need for group work and collaboration
        <!-- Principles of Programming Languages is a graduate class that falls neatly into the joke that all branchs of computer science are just applied math (whether thats discrete math for algorithms or linear algebra and probability for machine learning).  -->

    <h2> CS 839: Systems Verification </h2>
    <h2> PHILO 241: Introduction to ethics</h2>
